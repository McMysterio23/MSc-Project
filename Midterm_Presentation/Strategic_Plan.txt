Here in this Document you'll find the whole strategic plan about my midterm presentation, according also to what i saw from the other ones !!

DATE OF THE PRESENTATION : 16TH MAY 2025 11:30AM
Target Time for the whole presentation : 15 minutes


Already with the current division of slides there is enough space to fill 17 minutes, if i avoid rushing the things.
Keep in mind that i'll speak in English, not in Italian, so i have to prepare the speech also in order to have a slower pace than the one
i'd have if i were to speak in my native language !!!


Questions to answer during my presentation :

Q1 : What is my project about ? 
Q2 : Mathematical Tools that are useful to understand the Jitter ?
Q3 : What is the experimental Setup ?
	Q3_p2 : Procedure being implemented in my research ?
Q4 : What is being currently studied ?
Q5 : Discussion of the procedures currently implemented in the code and possible critical aspects that maybe need to be modified
Q6 : Discussion of the current plots that i've in my possession.



Answers to the Questions (State-of-the-art at the current date of 5-8-25)

AnQ1 : The Purpose of my research project is to study the temporal Jitter of MIO's Experimental setup in order to find a way to boost the single photon indistinguishability in the HOM interference scheme.

[... Needs to be extended...]

AnQ3 : Currently the Experimental setup, comprises the following elements : A continuous wavelength laser, two subsequent EOMs that work together with a FPGA and a pulse compressor. The resulting laser beam, has some specific features,
as result of these instruments (But currently the experimental setup has not already been studied to make a complete analysis towards the actual jitter contribution that appears as a result of all the different components that are included)

After completing this procedure of creation of the pulses, that can be approximatedly seen as Gaussian Shaped, the laser is then divided into two subsequent Beam Splitters !
The First Beam Splitter actually deviates part of the beam inside a power meter, that ensures a proper extimation of the power of the beam after the two EOMs.
Furthermore the second one is the most important, specifically for the first part of the
